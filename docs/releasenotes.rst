Release Notes
=============

.. _R4-0:

Changes since R3-7
-------------------------

  * add new JSON log format
  * add support for single and group pvputs
      Requires EPICS base version which supports this,
      at the time of writing it's not released yet

.. _R3-5:

.. _R3-4:

Changes since R3-3-3
--------------------

* expose some internal APIs to support non-IOC servers

  This patch was provided by John Priller <priller@frib.msu.edu>
  in order to user caPutLog inside the CA-Gateway. The header files
  caPutLogTask.h and caPutLogAs.h are now installed, and export
  the additional function caPutLogDataCalloc, enabling user code to
  send their own data (of type LOGDATA) to the caPutLogTask.
  Apart from a few small fixes normal use on an IOC is unaffected.
